# Financial-Data-Warehouse-SSIS-ETL-Architecture

# Project Documentation

   # Project Overview

This project utilizes SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) in Visual Studio to automate and streamline ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. The SSIS package is designed to extract data from multiple sources, transform it according to business logic, and load it into a structured SQL Server database for further analysis and reporting.

   # Technology Used

Microsoft SQL Server (Database Management)

SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) (ETL Process)

Visual Studio (SSIS Development Environment)

SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) (BI Tools for SSIS Package Development)

Power BI / Tableau (Data Visualization and Reporting)

# Project Objectives

Automate data extraction from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, SQL Databases).

Cleanse, validate, and transform the extracted data.

Load the processed data into a SQL Server data warehouse.

Optimize data processing performance.

Ensure error handling and logging mechanisms.

Schedule and automate the SSIS package execution.

# SSIS Package Workflow

1. Data Extraction (Extract Phase)

Extract data from multiple sources including:

SQL Server Databases

Flat Files (CSV, Excel)

Web Services / API (if applicable)

2. Data Transformation (Transform Phase)

Data Cleansing (removing duplicates, handling NULL values, standardizing formats)

Data Enrichment (joining data from multiple sources, applying business rules)

Data Type Conversion (ensuring compatibility with the destination database)

3. Data Loading (Load Phase)

Insert transformed data into the SQL Server Data Warehouse

Implement indexes and partitioning for performance optimization

# SSIS Package Components

Control Flow:

Sequence Containers (grouping tasks)

Data Flow Tasks (ETL operations)

Execute SQL Tasks (for database operations)

Script Tasks (custom logic using C# / VB.NET)

File System Tasks (handling files post-processing)

Logging and Error Handling

Data Flow:

Source Components (Flat File Source, OLE DB Source)

Transformation Components (Lookup, Conditional Split, Data Conversion, Derived Column)

Destination Components (OLE DB Destination, Flat File Destination)

# Deployment Process

Package Development:

Develop and test SSIS packages in Visual Studio.

Validate data transformation and loading processes.

Deployment to SQL Server:

Deploy the SSIS package to SQL Server using SQL Server Integration Services Catalog.

Configure package parameters and connection managers.

Job Scheduling with SQL Server Agent:

Create a new job in SQL Server Agent.

Schedule SSIS package execution at defined intervals.

Monitoring & Maintenance:

Use SSISDB Catalog Reports to monitor execution logs.

Handle errors using automated alerts and email notifications.

Optimize package performance periodically.

Error Handling & Logging

Implemented logging in SSIS using SSIS Log Providers.

Configured event handlers for error capturing.

Stored error logs in a dedicated SQL Server table.

Enabled email notifications for critical failures.

Performance Optimization Strategies

Used Batch Processing to load data in bulk.

Applied Indexes and Partitioning for faster query performance.

Optimized Lookup Transformations with caching.

Minimized Data Movement by processing transformations within SQL Server.

# Scheduling & Automation

Configured SQL Server Agent to schedule SSIS package execution.

Set up Job Monitoring and automated notifications.

# Conclusion

This SSIS project successfully automates ETL workflows, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and efficient processing. The structured approach enhances data quality, reduces manual efforts, and improves decision-making capabilities through streamlined reporting and analytics.
